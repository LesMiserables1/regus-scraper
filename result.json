The ground floor entrance opens into a shared space, adjacent to an artisan coffee shop – your first stop for your morning caffeine fix. If you’re looking for something different, head out to Bloor St. and visit nearby 2nd Nature Bakery and Cafe or Rancho Relaxo To Go Mexican restaurant, both popular local eateries. Bloor GO Train Station is a 15-minute walk away, ready to whisk you into the centre of Toronto. Additionally, there are buses departing regularly from a pair of stops just outside the centre. This area also boasts an inspirational cultural scene, with the Museum of Contemporary Art and Aluna Performing Arts Theatre both just a few blocks away."},"images":["https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_9:5,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_5.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto:subject,ar_7:10,h_197,w_142/CentreImagery/5261/5261_2.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_20:11,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_4.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_6.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_7.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_8.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_9.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_3.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,h_197/CentreImagery/5261/5261_1.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_9:5,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_5.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto:subject,ar_7:10,h_197,w_142/CentreImagery/5261/5261_2.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_20:11,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_4.jpg"],"highlitedImages":["https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_9:5,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_5.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto:subject,ar_7:10,h_197,w_142/CentreImagery/5261/5261_2.jpg","https://assets.iwgplc.com/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto,ar_20:11,w_351/CentreImagery/5261/5261_4.jpg"]},{"name":"180 John Street.","url":{"url":"https://www.regus.com/en-us/canada/toronto/180-john-street-4286"},"address":{"fullAddress":"Toronto, ON M5T 1X5, CAN","country":"Canada","state":"Ontario","city":"Toronto","mapsLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/dir//43.6506253,-79.3916827"},"workspaces":[{"office_type":"Office Space","AvailableForRent":"133","PriceRange":{"startingAt":"520","billingBasis":" per person per month"},"Features":["Add or remove space as your needs change","Flexible terms means you can grow without risk","Customize your space"]},{"office_type":"Coworking","AvailableForRent":"20","PriceRange":{"startingAt":"640","billingBasis":" per person per month"},"Features":["Thousands of locations","Book your hot desk via our app","Network and collaborate"]},{"office_type":"Virtual Office","PriceRange":{"startingAt":"89","billingBasis":" per month"},"Features":["Thousands of locations","Use of global business lounges","Phone answering available"]},{"office_type":"Meeting Rooms","AvailableForRent":"133","PriceRange":{"startingAt":"55","billingBasis":" per hour"},"Features":["1000s of rooms to choose from","Configure to suit your needs","Reception team to greet guests"]}],"features":["Major transport links","Meeting Rooms","Outside Seating Area / Terrace","Videoconferencing studio"],"featuresHighlited":["24 Hour Access","Break-Out Areas","City/Town Centre","Elevator"],"description":{"header":"An inspiring environment to do your best work","content":"Rated one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world by Vogue Magazine, Queen Street West is Toronto's artistic hub of urban pop culture and the home of this creative workspace.
