Both floors offer a column-free design and high ceilings, letting in floods of natural light from the continuous glass windows that encompass the building’s striking structure.

Both floors offer a column-free design and high ceilings, letting in floods of natural light from the continuous glass windows that encompass the building’s striking structure.

Both floors offer a column-free design and high ceilings, letting in floods of natural light from the continuous glass windows that encompass the building’s striking structure.
